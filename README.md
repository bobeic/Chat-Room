# Chat-Room

Make sure you have nodejs installed.
Once you have done that you can run npm install to get all the required packages.
To run do: node index.js
Then go to localhost:3000 and you should have a basic chat room running!
To test it you can open multiple tabs and you should see it updating in real time!
